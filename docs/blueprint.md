## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey a sense of premium quality and sophistication. The choice of purple gives an unconventional but memorable quality.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern look in light mode, switching to dark gray (#333333) in dark mode.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, providing a vibrant contrast against the purple and gray tones.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, fashionable, avant-garde presentation.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear and accessible descriptions of each tool's features. We use a font pairing here.
- Use a set of minimalist icons, custom-designed to represent each tool, ensuring they are intuitive and aesthetically consistent.
- Subtle animations for transitions and user interactions, enhancing the user experience without being distracting; for example, a smooth fade-in effect on image previews or tooltips.
